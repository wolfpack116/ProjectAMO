# Encoding Safety

Prevent shell redirection from corrupting UTF-8 source files.

## Rules

- Do not overwrite UTF-8 source files with PowerShell `Set-Content`, `Out-File`, or `>` redirection.
- Use `apply_patch` for manual edits.
- For mechanical rewrites, use Node:
  ```js
  const text = fs.readFileSync(path, 'utf8')
  fs.writeFileSync(path, newText, 'utf8')
  ```
- Do not trust PowerShell console output alone to verify Korean (or other non-ASCII) text. The file bytes may be correct even when the console shows mojibake.
- Verify non-ASCII text by reading with Node as UTF-8. When needed, inspect code points.

## When to apply

- Any source file edit that may contain Korean, Chinese, Japanese, or emoji.
- Build artifacts, migration scripts, or data fixtures that touch non-ASCII text.
