# Airport Weather Display Unification Status

Updated: 2026-05-21 21:32 KST
Plan: docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-21-airport-weather-display-unification.md

## Resume Point
- Last completed: Task 5 browser verification and final frontend test/build verification.
- Next: Final review and commit.

## Verified
- `node --test frontend/src/shared/weather/helpers.test.js` passed after RED failure for missing `hasSpecialWeather`.
- `node --test frontend/src/features/monitoring/legacy/utils/helpers.test.js` passed after RED failure for missing legacy `hasSpecialWeather`.
- `node --test frontend/src/features/airport-panel/lib/metarViewModel.test.js frontend/src/features/airport-panel/lib/tafViewModel.test.js` passed after RED failures for missing Airport highlight flags.
- Focused tests passed: shared helpers, monitoring helper compatibility, Airport METAR/TAF view models.
- Browser checked `http://localhost:5173/`: RKSS Airport TAF timeline/table/grid had no page-level horizontal scroll; table scroll was local.
- Browser checked RKNY: TAF `-RA` used precipitation classes in timeline/table and no dashed timeline special class; METAR `RA` current-weather card used precipitation tint and no special outline.
- Browser checked RKJB: METAR `BR` did not use precipitation tint or special outline.
- Browser checked `http://localhost:5173/monitoring`: route loaded, METAR/TAF content appeared, TAF view switcher worked, no page-level horizontal scroll.
- Final frontend tests: `$files = Get-ChildItem -Path 'frontend\src' -Recurse -Filter '*.test.js' | ForEach-Object { $_.FullName }; node --test $files` passed, 180 tests.
- `npm.cmd run build --prefix frontend` passed with existing large chunk warning.
- Read-only UI QA found no blocking UI/spec regressions; residual manual note was only that live local data lacked a true TS/FG/SN TAF table/grid case.

## Unverified / Skipped
- Browser screenshot capture timed out in the in-app browser; DOM/browser state checks were used instead.

## Deviations from Plan
- Architecture.md left unchanged because existing File Roles already cover shared weather helpers, Airport view models, Airport CSS, and monitoring legacy utilities.
